            My project is a recreation/parody of the famous chestburster scene
            from the movie <i>Alien</i>, directed by Ridley Scott.  The
            characters are Kane (played by Rich Otterson), Lambert (played by
            Sandra Nakasone), and Parker (played by Tom Lustig). And my dog
            Puck.
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
            First, I watched the scene <a href="https://youtu.be/AdBu6VAESeI">
            on Youtube</a> a few times to get a feel for what the important
            aspects of the scene were. I also found the
            <a href="http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/alien_shooting.html">
            script online</a> to see what the how the scene was written.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then transcribed the script as shot (from the video) using Amazon
            Storywriter.  I knew I would only have 3 actors (my girlfriend and
            two of my friends from high school), so I had to modify the script
            to fit those constraints. Luckily, the scene's dialog is mostly
            between three characters anyway, but I had to assign Ash's line to
            Lambert.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now using only my script, I made a
            <a href="storyboard.html">storyboard</a> and
            <a href="cameraplots.html">camera plots</a>. From the camera plots,
            I marked up <a href="script.html">my script</a> with camera angle
            numbers.
        </p>

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
            I filmed the scene at my parents house because their dining room
            table has a removable center leaf.  The first half of the shoot was
            straightforward, just read the script from different angles.  Once
            Rich starts coughing, it got more complicated.  I also decided to
            shoot most of the second half with the camera hand-held, to make it
            look more dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the effects happen off-camera.  The first blood splat was a
            completely separate shirt that I spread fake blood on.  So we shot
            the actors struggling, then Rich changed his shirt, and then we shot
            another struggling scene. But I edited it together with the splat
            sound effect during a cut to a quick reaction from the other
            characters, so it looks more seamless.  I did the same thing when
            Puck leaves the body and jumps off the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            To shoot the second blood splat, where the chest visibly jumps, I
            removed the table's center leaf and Rich got under the table and put
            his head through the tablecloth.  I stuffed the shirt with towels,
            and to make the chest pop, we cut a hole in the back of the shirt
            and Rich punched up from under the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the dog, we cut another hole in the front of the shirt and
            pushed Puck up through the hole.  I avoided shooting above the neck,
            because Rich couldn't hold his head there and get Puck through at
            the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>Post Production</h2>
        <p>
            The first half of the scene was straightforward to edit.  The second
            half was again more complicated. I discovered that I had forgotten
            to roll sound for 2 shots, but luckily there wasn't much lost
            because those shots would have picked us up trying to get Puck's
            attention to look different directions. I recorded some human sounds
            (gasps) for the reaction to Puck coming out of the chest.  For
            scared breathing of the actors, I just looped some of the audio from
            other shots. I recorded my dog playing tug-of-war with me with a
            rope toy for the growling and a couple barks.  Any silence left was
            covered up by a myriad of sound effects I got from
            <a href="http://freesound.org">freesound.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides sound, I made some effects during the final shot of Puck
            jumping off the table and running away.  I used the
            <a href="sequence.html">three camera shake/jitter effects</a>
            demonstrated in
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5jaj3tOddw">this
            tutorial</a>; when Puck lands on the floor, when he runs through the
            door, and right before the video cuts off.  In addition, I digitally
            zoomed the footage so that it looks kind of like a found-footage
            clip with crash zooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the title card, I did some searching and found
            <a href="https://typesetinthefuture.com/2014/12/01/alien/">some
            website</a> that said the
            <a href="https://unaffiliatedcritic.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Alien-Title-Card.jpg">
            original Alien title sequence</a> used Helvetica Black. So I just
            put ALIEN in Helvetica Black and DOG in Helvetica Light, and turned
            the kerning way up.
