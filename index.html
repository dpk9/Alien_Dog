            My project is a recreation/parody of the famous chestburster scene from the movie <i>Alien</i>, directed by Ridley Scott.  The characters are Kane (played by Rich Otterson), Lambert (played by Sandra Nakasone), and Parker (played by Tom Lustig). And my dog Puck.
        </p>

        <h2>Development</h2>
        <p>
            First, I watched the scene <a href="https://youtu.be/AdBu6VAESeI">on Youtube</a> a few times to get a feel for what the important aspects of the scene were. I also found the <a href="http://www.dailyscript.com/scripts/alien_shooting.html">script online</a> to see what the how the scene was written.
        </p>
        <p>
            I then transcribed the script as shot (from the video) using Amazon Storywriter.  I knew I would only have 3 actors (my girlfriend and two of my friends from high school), so I had to modify the script to fit those constraints. Luckily, the scene's dialog is mostly between three characters anyway, but I had to assign Ash's line to Lambert.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now using only my script, I made a <a href="storyboard.html">storyboard</a> and <a href="cameraplots.html">camera plots</a>. From the camera plots, I marked up <a href="script.html">my script</a> with camera angle numbers.
        </p>

        <h2>Production</h2>
        <p>
            I filmed the scene at my parents house because their dining room table has a removable center leaf.  The first half of the shoot was straightforward, just read the script from different angles.  Once Rich starts coughing, it got more complicated.  I also decided to shoot most of the second half with the camera hand-held, to make it look more dynamic.
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the effects happen off-camera.  The first blood splat was a completely separate shirt that I spread fake blood on.  So we shot the actors struggling, then Rich changed his shirt, and then we shot another struggling scene. But I edited it together with the splat sound effect during a cut to a quick reaction from the other characters, so it looks more seamless.  I did the same thing when Puck leaves the body and jumps off the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            To shoot the second blood splat, where the chest visibly jumps, I removed the table's center leaf and Rich got under the table and put his head through the tablecloth.  I stuffed the shirt with towels, and to make the chest pop, we cut a hole in the back of the shirt and Rich punched up from under the table.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the dog, we cut another hole in the front of the shirt and pushed Puck up through the hole.  I avoided shooting above the neck, because Rich couldn't hold his head there and get Puck through at the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>Post Production</h2>
        <p>
            The first half of the scene was straightforward to edit.  The second half was again more complicated. I discovered that I had forgotten to roll sound for 2 shots, but luckily there wasn't much lost because those shots would have picked us up trying to get Puck's attention to look different directions. I recorded some human sounds (gasps) for the reaction to Puck coming out of the chest.  For scared breathing, I just looped some of the audio from other shots.  And then a lot of the silence was covered up by a myriad of sound effects I got from <a href="http://freesound.org">freesound.org</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides sound, I made some effects for the final shot of Puck jumping off the table and running away.  I used the three camera shake/jitter effects shown in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5jaj3tOddw">this tutorial</a>; when Puck lands on the floor, when he runs through the door, and right before the video cuts off.  In addition, I digitally zoomed the footage so that it looks like the camera operator did crash zooms in on the "monster," to make it look kind of like a found-footage clip.
